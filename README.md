UPDATE:
jService has been taken offline. Unfortunately, without the use of that API, trivia-clone is no more. I am working on hosting the jService API myself. If I can get that up and running, we'll be back online.

------------------

I created this site to help me learn React. This is a front-end only trivia clone that uses jservice.io for the Jeopardy question data. Thanks to jservice.io for providing this service. All code is my own. All CSS has been done by hand. There are undoubtedly many bugs, but please enjoy.
