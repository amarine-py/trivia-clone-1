# trivia-clone-1
I created this site to help me learn React. This is a front-end only trivia clone that uses jservice.io for the Jeopardy question data. Thanks to jservice.io for providing this service. All code is my own. All CSS has been done by hand. There are undoubtedly many bugs, but please enjoy.

See the About page for more details.
